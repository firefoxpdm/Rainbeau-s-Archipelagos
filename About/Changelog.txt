  Changelog for "Rainbeau's Archipelagos"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- 12/05/2018
	- Fixed an error created by the fact that "Infectious Creatures" redefines
	  cobras in a way that made the mod think they were mod-added rather than
	  vanilla creatures.
	- Rewrote XML patches to improve load efficiency slightly.

- 10/14/2018
	- Updated to RimWorld 1.0 release!

- 09/29/2018
	- Added that ability to configure the "water level" on generated maps.
	- Increased slightly the amount of shallow water around islands, to make the
	  transition from land to deep water a bit less extreme.
	
- 09/23/2018
	- Eliminated no longer necessary (and potentially problematic) conditionals 
	  based on the presence of "Fertile Fields" in mod list.
	- Updated the version of the Harmony library the mod uses.

- 09/16/2018
	- Updated to RimWorld b19 release.
	- Removed "Mod Sync Ninja" files.

- 12/05/2017
	- Freshwater and ocean variants of each archipelago type now have different
	  labels. (This is really no big deal unless you're using "Prepare Landing,"
	  and need to be able to tell the versions apart in the biome listing.)

- 12/04/2017
	- The mod now works with the "Mod Sync Ninja" updater.
	  
- 12/03/2017
	- Ambrosia can now sprout on islands as well as on the mainland. Also, alpha
	  beavers have discovered the joys of island life.
	  
- 12/02/2017
	- Wild plants added by mods will also now appear on appropriate archipelago
	  maps.

- 11/18/2017
	- Animals added by mods will now be eligible to appear in archipelago biomes
	  corresponding to the vanilla biomes to which they're assigned.

- 11/13/2017
	- Added Chinese language translation files provided by kghostSATORI.

- 11/07/2017
	- Updated to RimWorld b18 release.
	- Added swampy archipelagos to match new vanilla swampy biomes.
	- Updated the "FishIndustry" patches.

- 09/24/2017
	- Squashed a bug related to rocky soil from my "Fertile Fields" mod, that was
	  spawning error messages if maps were generated with neither "Configurable
	  Maps" nor "Fertile Fields" in the mod list.

- 09/23/2017
	- Maps won't have quite so many archipelagos as they previously did.
	- The incidence of (especially boreal) archipelagos showing up near coasts of
	  a different climate type has been substantially reduced.
	- Tundra archipelagos will no longer appear in the middle of otherwise solid
	  regions of sea ice.
	- Archipelagos in lakes will now feature islands surrounded by fresh water
	  instead of ocean water. (On a related note, inland bodies of water must now
	  be significantly larger than in vanilla to be considered oceans instead of
	  lakes.)
	- Since nobody at all seemed to like the orangish archipelago tiles, they've
	  been replaced with tiles that are just slightly darker and more bluish than
	  those of the corresponding vanilla biome tiles.

- 09/19/2017
	- Though most archipelagos remain flat maps, some are now small hills maps, 
	  and a few are actually large hills maps.
	- Replaced the "polka dot" world map archipelago tiles with solid tiles, with
	  orangish tints. (Why orange? Because nothing on the world map was already 
	  orange. The archipelagos will be easy to spot.)
	- Added patches to allow "FishIndustry" fish to be caught in archipelagos.

- 09/17/2017
	- Initial release.
